=== How to use integrate ImGuiBundle into your application

This directory is a **standalone** demonstration on how to easily integrate ImGuiBundle to your own project. This means that you can copy-paste this folder in your project, and it will build, with no extra step!

TIP: you do *not* need to clone or download `ImGui Bundle`. It will be done by cmake automatically.


==== Cmake: downloads and build ImGui Bundle

The link:CMakeLists.txt[CMakeLists.txt] file will

* download imgui_bundle at configure time
* make the `imgui_bundle_add_app` cmake function available
* use `imgui_bundle_add_app` to build your app and link it with ImGuiBundle
