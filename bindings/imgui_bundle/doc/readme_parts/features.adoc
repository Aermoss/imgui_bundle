== Features


ImGui Bundle is build on top of https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui[HelloImGui], which provides:

* DPI aware applications (window size, font loading and scaling, etc)
* Power Save mode: reduce FPS when application is idle
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhartw0cUjg[Theme tweaking]
* Window geometry utilities (autosize, restore window position)
* Assets embedding on all platforms
* Auto initialization of third parties modules (implot, imgui-node-editor, markdown, etc)
* Switch between Glfw or Sdl backend

NOTE: The usage of `Hello ImGui` is optional. You can also build an imgui application from scratch, in C++ or in python (see link:../../demos_python/demos_immapp/imgui_example_glfw_opengl3.py[python example])
