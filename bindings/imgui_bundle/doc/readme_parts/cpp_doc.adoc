=== Integrate ImGui Bundle in your own project in 5 minutes

The folder link:{url-bundle-main-tree}/_example_integration[example_integration] includes everything you need to set up your own project with ImGui Bundle.

=== Build ImGui Bundle from source

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
cd imgui_bundle
git submodule update --init --recursive # <1>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j # <2>
----

<1> Since there are lots of submodules, this might take a few minutes
<2> The build process might take up to 5 minutes

=== Run the C++ demo

Simply run `./bin/demo_imgui_bundle`.


The source for the demos can be found inside link:{url-bindings-bundle}/demos_cpp/[bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_cpp].


TIP: Consider `demo_imgui_bundle` as a manual for ImGui Bundle with lots of examples and related code source. It is always {url-demo-imgui-bundle}[available online]
