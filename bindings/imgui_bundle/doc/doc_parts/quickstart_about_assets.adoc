=== About assets

HelloImGui and ImmApp applications rely on the presence of an `assets` folder.
The typical layout of an assets folder looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
assets/
    +-- app_settings/                     # Application settings
    |         +-- icon.png                # This will be the app icon, it should be square
    |         |                           # and at least 512x512. It will  be converted
    |         |                           # to the right format, for each platform.
    |         +-- apple/
    |         |         â””-- Info.plist    # macOS and iOS app settings
    |         |                           # (or Info.ios.plist + Info.macos.plist)
    +-- fonts/
    |         +-- DroidSans.ttf                       # Default fonts used by HelloImGui to
    |         +-- fontawesome-webfont.ttf             # improve text rendering (esp. on High DPI)
    |         |                                       # if absent, a default LowRes font is used.
    |         |
    |         +-- Roboto/                             # Optional: fonts for markdown
    |         |         +-- LICENSE.txt
    |         |         +-- Roboto-Bold.ttf
    |         |         +-- Roboto-BoldItalic.ttf
    |         |         +-- Roboto-Regular.ttf
    |         |         +-- Roboto-RegularItalic.ttf
    |         +-- SourceCodePro-Regular.ttf           # Optional: font / markdown
    +-- images/
              +-- markdown_broken_image.png           # Optional: used for markdown
              |
              +-- world.jpg                           # Add anything in the assets folder!

You can change the assets folder via `HelloImGui::SetAssetsFolder` ({cpp}) or `hello_imgui.set_assets_folder` (python).



**Where to find the default assets**

You can link:https://traineq.org/ImGuiBundle/assets.zip[download the default assets as a zip file].

Look at the folder link:https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets[imgui_bundle/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets] to see their content.


**Where to place your assets folder**

You can either:

* copy it into your execution folder (_{cpp} and python_)
* place it besides your CMakeLists.txt, and it will be deployed into the execution folder automatically (_{cpp} only_)
