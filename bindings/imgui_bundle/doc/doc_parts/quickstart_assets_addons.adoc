NOTE: This demo relies on the presence of an "assets" folder.
Look at the link:https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets[imgui_bundle/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets] folder which provides it. You can either copy it besides your CMakeLists.txt, or into your execution folder.
