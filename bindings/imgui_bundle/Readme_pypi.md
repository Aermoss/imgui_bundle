# Introduction

## About ImGui Bundle

[ImGui Bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) is a bundle for
[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), including various
powerful libraries from its ecosystem. It enables to easily create ImGui
applications in C++ and Python, under Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is
aimed at application developers, researchers, and beginners who want to
quickly get started.

This demonstration is also an interactive manual, similar to the online
[ImGui
Manual](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html)

    a Sublime Text or VSCode style command palette in ImGui

## Easily port your code between python and C++

The python bindings were autogenerated from the original C code and they
closely mirror the original C API, with fully typed bindings, so that
code completion works like a charm.

The original code documentation is meticulously kept inside the python
stubs. See for example the documentation for
[imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/__init__.pyi)
,
[implot](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/implot.pyi),
and [hello
imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi)

Thanks to this, porting code between Python and C++ becomes easy.

# Usage with Python

## Install from pypi

    pip install imgui-bundle
    pip install opencv-contrib-python 

-   in order to run the immvision module, install opencv-python or
    opencv-contrib-python

Note: under windows, you might need to install [msvc
redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

## Install from source:

    git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
    cd imgui_bundle
    git submodule update --init --recursive 
    pip install -v . 
    pip install opencv-contrib-python

-   Since there are lots of submodules, this might take a few minutes

-   The build process might take up to 5 minutes

## Run the python demo

Simply run `imgui_bundle_demo`.

The source for the demos can be found inside
[bindings/imgui\_bundle/demos\_python](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python).

Consider `imgui_bundle_demo` as an always available manual for ImGui
Bundle with lots of examples and related code source.

# Usage with C++

## Integrate ImGui Bundle in your own project in 5 minutes

The folder
[example\_integration](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/_example_integration)
includes everything you need to set up your own project with ImGui
Bundle.

## Build ImGui Bundle from source

    git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
    cd imgui_bundle
    git submodule update --init --recursive 
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j 

-   Since there are lots of submodules, this might take a few minutes

-   The build process might take up to 5 minutes

## Run the C++ demo

Simply run `./bin/demo_imgui_bundle`.

The source for the demos can be found inside
[bindings/imgui\_bundle/demos\_cpp](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_cpp/).

Consider `demo_imgui_bundle` as a manual for ImGui Bundle with lots of
examples and related code source. It is always [available
online](https://traineq.org/ImGuiBundle/emscripten/bin/demo_imgui_bundle.html)

# Features

ImGui Bundle is build on top of
[HelloImGui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui), which provides:

-   DPI aware applications (window size, font loading and scaling, etc)

-   Power Save mode: reduce FPS when application is idle

-   [Theme tweaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhartw0cUjg)

-   Window geometry utilities (autosize, restore window position)

-   Assets embedding on all platforms

-   Auto initialization of third parties modules (implot,
    imgui-node-editor, markdown, etc)

-   Switch between Glfw or Sdl backend

The usage of `Hello ImGui` is optional. You can also build an imgui
application from scratch, in C++ or in python (see [python
example](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/demos_immapp/imgui_example_glfw_opengl3.py))
