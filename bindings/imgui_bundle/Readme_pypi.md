## Easily port your code between python and C++

The python bindings are autogenerated via an advanced generator (so that
keeping them up to date is easy), and closely mirror the original C++
API, with fully typed bindings.

The original code documentation is meticulously kept inside the python
stubs. See for example the documentation for
[imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/__init__.pyi)
,
[implot](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/implot.pyi),
and [hello
imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi)

Thanks to this, code completion in your favorite python IDE works like a
charm, and porting code between Python and C++ becomes easy.

GPT can help you translate between C++ and Python: see [this
conversation](https://chat.openai.com/share/1e61dfec-c2de-4c2a-8149-24926276bbd5)
where GPT4 was used to translate code and summarize the differences
between the C++ and Python APIs.

# Build and install instructions

## Install for Python

### Install from pypi

    pip install imgui-bundle
    pip install opencv-contrib-python 

-   in order to run the immvision module, install opencv-python or
    opencv-contrib-python

Note: under windows, you might need to install [msvc
redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

### Install from source:

    git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
    cd imgui_bundle
    git submodule update --init --recursive 
    pip install -v . 
    pip install opencv-contrib-python

-   Since there are lots of submodules, this might take a few minutes

-   The build process might take up to 5 minutes

### Run the python demo

Simply run `demo_imgui_bundle`.

The source for the demos can be found inside
[bindings/imgui\_bundle/demos\_python](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python).

Consider `demo_imgui_bundle` as an always available manual for Dear
ImGui Bundle with lots of examples and related code source.

## Install for C++

### Integrate Dear ImGui Bundle in your own project in 5 minutes

The easiest way to use Dear ImGui Bundle in an external project is to
use the example provided in
[example\_integration](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/_example_integration).
This folder includes everything you need to set up your own project.

### Build from source

If you choose to clone this repo, follow these instructions:

    git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
    cd imgui_bundle
    git submodule update --init --recursive 
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DIMMVISION_FETCH_OPENCV=ON 
    make -j

-   Since there are lots of submodules, this might take a few minutes

-   The flag `-DIMMVISION_FETCH_OPENCV=ON` is optional. If set, a
    minimal version of OpenCV will be downloaded a compiled at this
    stage (this might require a few minutes)

The `immvision` module will only be built if OpenCV can be found.
Otherwise, it will be ignored, and no error will be emitted.

If you have an existing OpenCV install, set its path via:

    cmake .. -DOpenCV_DIR=/.../path/to/OpenCVConfig.cmake

### Run the C++ demo

If you built ImGuiBundle from source, Simply run
`build/bin/demo_imgui_bundle`.

The source for the demos can be found inside
[bindings/imgui\_bundle/demos\_cpp](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_cpp/).

Consider `demo_imgui_bundle` as a manual with lots of examples and
related code source. It is always [available
online](https://traineq.org/ImGuiBundle/emscripten/bin/demo_imgui_bundle.html)

# Quick Start & Examples

Install Dear ImGui Bundle following the [Build and install
instructions](#install-instructions).

All of the examples provided below are available in the [interactive
manual](https://traineq.org/ImGuiBundle/emscripten/bin/demo_imgui_bundle.html),
where you can test them in action and look at their code at the same
time.

## Hello, World

![demo
hello](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/with_test_engine/bindings/imgui_bundle/doc/doc_images//demo_hello.jpg)

[Run this demo in your
browser](https://traineq.org/ImGuiBundle/emscripten/bin/demo_hello_world.html)

### Hello, World in C++

*[demo\_hello\_world.cpp](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_cpp/demos_immapp/demo_hello_world.cpp)*

    #include "immapp/immapp.h"
    #include "imgui.h"

    void Gui()
    {
        ImGui::Text("Hello, world!");
    }

    int main(int, char **)
    {
        ImmApp::Run(
            Gui,
            "Hello!",
            true // window_size_auto
            // Uncomment the next line to restore window position and size from previous run
            // , true // windowRestorePreviousGeometry
        );

        return 0;
    }

#### Build with cmake (using imgui\_bundle as a submodule)

First, add imgui\_bundle as a submodule:

    git submodule add https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
    cd imgui_bundle
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Then, write a simple CMakeLists file where you add imgui\_bundle, then
call `imgui_bundle_add_app` to create your application.

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
    project(imgui_bundle_hello)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

    add_subdirectory(imgui_bundle)
    imgui_bundle_add_app(hello_world hello_world.cpp)

#### Build with cmake (without imgui\_bundle as a submodule)

Copy this
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/_example_integration/CMakeLists.txt)
file: it will download and compile imgui-bundle during your app
compilation.

This cmake file is part of a quick start example available
[here](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/_example_integration).

### Hello, World in Python

[demo\_hello\_world.py](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/demos_immapp/demo_hello_world.py)

    from imgui_bundle import imgui, immapp


    def gui():
        imgui.text("Hello, world!")


    immapp.run(
        gui_function=gui,  # The Gui function to run
        window_title="Hello!",  # the window title
        window_size_auto=True,  # Auto size the application window given its widgets
        # Uncomment the next line to restore window position and size from previous run
        # window_restore_previous_geometry==True
    )

## Using assets & add-ons (ImPlot, Markdown)

![demo assets
addons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/with_test_engine/bindings/imgui_bundle/doc/doc_images//demo_assets_addons.jpg)

[Run this demo in your
browser](https://traineq.org/ImGuiBundle/emscripten/bin/demo_assets_addons.html)

This demonstration showcases how to:

-   Load and use assets (fonts, images, icons, etc.)

-   Use ImPlot to display various types of plots

-   Use markdown to display formatted messages

Its source code is heavily documented and should be self-explanatory.

C++

    #include "hello_imgui/hello_imgui.h"
    #include "immapp/immapp.h"
    #include "imgui_md_wrapper/imgui_md_wrapper.h"
    #include "implot/implot.h"
    #include "immapp/code_utils.h"
    #include "demo_utils/api_demos.h"
    #include <vector>
    #include <map>


    // This function returns the different help strings that are displayed in this demo application
    std::string GetDoc(const std::string& whichDoc);


    // Your global application state, that will be edited during the execution
    struct AppState
    {
        // you can edit the ImPlot pie chart values
        std::vector<float> PlotData = {0.15f, 0.30f, 0.2f, 0.05f};

        // You can edit a demo markdown string
        char MarkdownInput[4000] = "*Welcome to the interactive markdown demo!* Try writing some markdown content here.";

        // Flags that set whether we show help strings
        bool ShowAssetsInfo = false;
        bool ShowMarkdownInfo = false;
        bool ShowImplotInfo = false;

        //
        // Note about AppState:
        // Inside ImGui demo code, you will often see static variables, such as in this example
        // ```cpp
        //     static int value = 10;
        //     bool changed = ImGui::SliderInt("Value", &value, 0, 10);  // edit this variable between 0 and 10
        // ```
        // In this example, `value` is a static variable whose state is preserved:
        // it merely acts as a global variable, whose scope is limited to this function.
        // Global variables should be avoided, and storing the Application State like this is preferable in production code.
        //
    };


    // A demo showcasing the assets usage in HelloImGui and ImmApp
    void DemoAssets(AppState& appState)
    {
        ImGuiMd::RenderUnindented(GetDoc("AssetsIntro"));

        ImGui::Text(ICON_FA_INFO " " ICON_FA_EXCLAMATION_TRIANGLE " " ICON_FA_SAVE);


        ImGui::Text("Here is an image that was loaded from the assets: ");
        ImGui::SameLine(); ImGui::SetCursorPosX(HelloImGui::EmSize(40.f));

        // Prefer to specify sizes using the "em" unit: see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)
        //     Below, imageSize is equivalent to the size of 5 lines of text
        ImVec2 imageSize = HelloImGui::EmToVec2(3.f, 3.f);
        HelloImGui::ImageFromAsset("images/world.jpg", imageSize);

        // Display help
        ImGui::Checkbox("More info", &appState.ShowAssetsInfo);
        if (appState.ShowAssetsInfo)
            ImGuiMd::RenderUnindented(GetDoc("AssetsDoc"));
    }


    // A demo about the usage of the markdown renderer
    void DemoMarkdown(AppState& appState)
    {

                    **About assets**

                    HelloImGui and ImmApp applications rely on the presence of an `assets` folder.
                    The typical layout of an assets folder looks like this:
                    ```
                    assets/
                        +-- fonts/
                        |         +-- DroidSans.ttf             # default fonts used by HelloImGui in order to
                        |         +-- fontawesome-webfont.ttf   # improve text rendering.
                        +-- images/
                                  +-- world.jpg                 # you can add any asset here!
                    ```

                    You can change the assets folder via:
                    ```cpp
                    HelloImGui::SetAssetsFolder("my_assets"); // (By default, HelloImGui will search inside "assets")
                    ```


                    **Where to find the default assets**

                    Look at the [imgui_bundle/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets) folder which provides them.
                    You can either copy it besides your CMakeLists.txt (it will be deployed into the execution folder automatically), or copy it into your execution folder.


                    **How was this image displayed**

                    This image was found inside the assets folder at `assets/images/world.jpg` and displayed via HelloImGui with the following code:
                    ```cpp
                    ImVec2 imageSize = HelloImGui::EmToVec2(5.f, 5.f);
                    HelloImGui::ImageFromAsset("images/world.jpg", imageSize);
                    ```

                    *Note: prefer to specify sizes using the ["em" unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)). Here, `imageSize` is equivalent to the size of 5 lines of text.*

                    )"
                },
                {
                    "MarkdownDoc",
                    R"(
                    This markdown string was rendered by calling:
                    ```cpp
                    ImGuiMd::Render(markdown_string);           // render a markdown string
                    // or
                    ImGuiMd::RenderUnindented(markdown_string);  // remove top-most indentation before rendering
                    ```

                    This markdown renderer is based on [imgui_md](https://github.com/mekhontsev/imgui_md), by Dmitry Mekhontsev.
                    It supports the most common markdown features: emphasis, link, code blocks, etc.

                    In order to work, it needs a few files in the assets folder:
                    ```
                    assets/
                    +-- fonts/
                    |         +-- DroidSans.ttf
                    |         +-- Roboto/
                    |         |         +-- LICENSE.txt
                    |         |         +-- Roboto-Bold.ttf

                        +-- markdown_broken_image.png
                    ```

                    Note: in order to use ImPlot, you need to "activate" this add-on, like this:
                    ```cpp
                    ImmApp::AddOnsParams addons { .withMarkdown = true };
                    ImmApp::Run(runnerParams, addons);
                    ```
                    )"

                **About assets**

                HelloImGui and ImmApp applications rely on the presence of an `assets` folder.
                The typical layout of an assets folder looks like this:
                ```
                assets/
                    +-- fonts/
                    |         +-- DroidSans.ttf             # default fonts used by HelloImGui in order to
                    |         +-- fontawesome-webfont.ttf   # improve text rendering.

                ```

                You can change the assets folder via:
                ```cpp
                hello_imgui.set_assets_folder("my_assets"); // (By default, HelloImGui will search inside "assets")
                ```

                **Where to find the default assets**

                Look at the [imgui_bundle/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/assets) folder which provides them.
                You can copy it into your execution folder.

                **How was this image displayed**

                This image was found inside the assets folder at `assets/images/world.jpg` and displayed via HelloImGui with the following code:
                ```python
                image_size = hello_imgui.em_to_vec2(5., 5.)
                hello_imgui.image_from_asset("images/world.jpg", imageSize);

# Usage instructions

## Dear ImGui - Immediate GUI

Dear ImGui is an implementation of the Immediate Gui paradigm.

### Dear ImGui demo (and manual)

Dear ImGui comes with a complete demo. It demonstrates all the widgets,
together with an example code on how to use them.

To run this demo in your browser, launch [ImGui
Manual](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html).  
  
For each widget, you will see the corresponding demo code (in C++. Read
the part "C++ / Python porting advices" to see how easy it is to
translate Gui code from C++ to python.

### Dear ImGui C++ API

Dear ImGui’s C++ API is thoroughly documented in its header files:

-   [main API](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/imgui.h)

-   [internal
    API](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/imgui_internal.h)

### Dear ImGui Python API

The python API closely mirrors the C++ API, and its documentation is
extremely easy to access from your IDE, via thoroughly documented stub
(\*.pyi) files.

-   [main
    API](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/__init__.pyi)

-   [internal
    API](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/internal.pyi)

### Example

An example is often worth a thousand words, the following code:

C++

    // Display a text
    ImGui::Text("Counter = %i", app_state.counter);
    ImGui::SameLine(); // by default ImGui starts a new line at each widget

    // The following line displays a button
    if (ImGui::Button("increment counter"))
        // And returns true if it was clicked: you can *immediately* handle the click
        app_state.counter += 1;

    // Input a text: in C++, InputText returns a bool and modifies the text directly
    bool changed = ImGui::InputText("Your name?", &app_state.name);
    ImGui::Text("Hello %s!", app_state.name.c_str());

Python

    # Display a text
    imgui.text(f"Counter = {app_state.counter}")
    imgui.same_line()  # by default ImGui starts a new line at each widget

    # The following line displays a button
    if imgui.button("increment counter"):
        # And returns true if it was clicked: you can *immediately* handle the click
        app_state.counter += 1

    # Input a text: in python, input_text returns a tuple(modified, new_value)
    changed, app_state.name = imgui.input_text("Your name?", app_state.name)
    imgui.text(f"Hello {app_state.name}!")

Displays this:

![immediate gui
example](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/raw/doc/bindings/imgui_bundle/doc/doc_images/immediate_gui_example.png)

## Hello ImGui - Starter pack

Dear ImGui Bundle includes [Hello
ImGui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui), which is itself based on
ImGui. "Hello ImGui" can be compared to a starter pack that enables to
easily write cross-platform Gui apps for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and
[emscripten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emscripten).

### API

See the "Hello ImGui" [API
doc](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/blob/master/src/hello_imgui/hello_imgui_api.md).
Also consult the doc on how to build [DPI
aware](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/tree/master/src/hello_imgui/dpi_aware.h)
applications.

### Features

-   Full multiplatform support: Windows, Linux, OSX, iOS, Emscripten,
    Android (poorly supported). See demo
    [video](https://traineq.org/HelloImGui_6_Platforms.mp4)

-   Advanced layout handling

-   Power Save mode: reduce FPS when application is idle (see
    [RunnerParams.fpsIdle](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/blob/master/src/hello_imgui/runner_params.h))

-   [DPI
    aware](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/tree/master/src/hello_imgui/dpi_aware.h)
    applications (widget placement, window size, font loading and
    scaling)

-   Theme tweaking (see [demo
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f_-3DDcAZk), and
    [API](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/blob/master/src/hello_imgui/imgui_theme.h)
    )

-   Window geometry utilities: autosize, restore window position, full
    screen, etc. (see
    [WindowGeometry](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/blob/master/src/hello_imgui/app_window_params.h))

-   Multiplatform [assets
    embedding](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/blob/master/src/hello_imgui/hello_imgui_assets.h)

-   Switch between Glfw or Sdl backend (see
    [RunnerParams.backendType](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/blob/master/src/hello_imgui/runner_params.h))

The usage of `Hello ImGui` is optional. You can also build an imgui
application from scratch, in C++ or in python (see [python
example](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/demos_immapp/imgui_example_glfw_opengl3.py))

HelloImGui is fully configurable by POD (plain old data) structures. See
[their
description](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/blob/master/src/hello_imgui/hello_imgui_api.md)

### Advanced layout and theming with Hello ImGui:

See the demo named "demo\_docking", which demonstrates:

-   How to handle complex layouts: you can define several layouts and
    switch between them: each layout which will remember the user
    modifications and the list of opened windows

-   How to use theming

-   How to store you own user settings in the app ini file

-   How to add a status bar and a log window

-   How to reduce the FPS when idling (to reduce CPU usage)

## ImmApp - Immediate App

ImGui Bundle includes a library named ImmApp (which stands for Immediate
App). ImmApp is a thin extension of HelloImGui that enables to easily
initialize the ImGuiBundle addons that require additional setup at
startup

### API

[C++
API](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/external/immapp/immapp/runner.h)

[Python
bindings](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/doc/bindings/imgui_bundle/immapp/immapp_cpp.pyi)

### How to start an application with addons

Some libraries included by ImGui Bundle require an initialization at
startup. ImmApp makes this easy via AddOnParams.

The example program below demonstrates how to run an application which
will use implot (which requires a context to be created at startup), and
imgui\_md (which requires additional fonts to be loaded at startup).

C++

    #include "immapp/immapp.h"
    #include "imgui_md_wrapper/imgui_md_wrapper.h"
    #include "implot/implot.h"
    #include "demo_utils/api_demos.h"
    #include <vector>
    #include <cmath>


    int main(int, char**)
    {
        // This call is specific to the ImGui Bundle interactive manual. In a standard application, you could write:
        //         HelloImGui::SetAssetsFolder("my_assets"); // (By default, HelloImGui will search inside "assets")
        ChdirBesideAssetsFolder();

        constexpr double pi = 3.1415926535897932384626433;
        std::vector<double> x, y1, y2;
        for (double _x = 0; _x < 4 * pi; _x += 0.01)
        {
            x.push_back(_x);
            y1.push_back(std::cos(_x));
            y2.push_back(std::sin(_x));
        }

        auto gui = [x,y1,y2]()
        {
            ImGuiMd::Render("# This is the plot of _cosinus_ and *sinus*");  // Markdown
            if (ImPlot::BeginPlot("Plot"))
            {
                ImPlot::PlotLine("y1", x.data(), y1.data(), x.size());
                ImPlot::PlotLine("y2", x.data(), y2.data(), x.size());
                ImPlot::EndPlot();
            }
        };

        HelloImGui::SimpleRunnerParams runnerParams { .guiFunction = gui, .windowSize = {600, 400} };
        ImmApp::AddOnsParams addons { .withImplot = true, .withMarkdown = true };
        ImmApp::Run(runnerParams, addons);

        return 0;
    }

Python:

    import numpy as np
    from imgui_bundle import implot, imgui_md, immapp
    from imgui_bundle.demos_python import demo_utils


    def main():
        # This call is specific to the ImGui Bundle interactive manual. In a standard application, you could write:
        #         hello_imgui.set_assets_folder("my_assets"); # (By default, HelloImGui will search inside "assets")
        demo_utils.set_hello_imgui_demo_assets_folder()

        x = np.arange(0, np.pi * 4, 0.01)
        y1 = np.cos(x)
        y2 = np.sin(x)

        def gui():
            imgui_md.render("# This is the plot of _cosinus_ and *sinus*")  # Markdown
            if implot.begin_plot("Plot"):
                implot.plot_line("y1", x, y1)
                implot.plot_line("y2", x, y2)
                implot.end_plot()

        immapp.run(gui, with_implot=True, with_markdown=True, window_size=(600, 400))


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

## Using Dear ImGui Bundle with jupyter notebook

ImmApp adds support for integration inside jupyter notebook: the
application will be run in an external window, and a screenshot will be
placed on the notebook after execution.

This requires a window server, and will not run on google collab.

Below is a screenshot, that you can test by running `jupyter notebook`
inside `bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python/notebooks`

# C++ / Python porting advices

## General advices

ImGui is a C++ library that was ported to Python. In order to work with
it, you will often refer to its
[manual](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html),
which shows example code in C++.

In order to translate from C++ to Python:

1.  Change the function names and parameters' names from `CamelCase` to
    `snake_case`

2.  Change the way the output are handled.

    1.  in C++ `ImGui::RadioButton` modifies its second parameter (which
        is passed by address) and returns true if the user clicked the
        radio button.

    2.  In python, the (possibly modified) value is transmitted via the
        return: `imgui.radio_button` returns a `Tuple[bool, str]` which
        contains `(user_clicked, new_value)`.

3.  if porting some code that uses static variables, use the
    `@immapp.static` decorator. In this case, this decorator simply adds
    a variable `value` at the function scope. It is preserved between
    calls. Normally, this variable should be accessed via
    `demo_radio_button.value`, however the first line of the function
    adds a synonym named static for more clarity. Do not overuse them!
    Static variable suffer from almost the same shortcomings as global
    variables, so you should prefer to modify an application state.

### Example:

C++

    void DemoRadioButton()
    {
        static int value = 0;
        ImGui::RadioButton("radio a", &value, 0); ImGui::SameLine();
        ImGui::RadioButton("radio b", &value, 1); ImGui::SameLine();
        ImGui::RadioButton("radio c", &value, 2);
    }

Python

    @immapp.static(value=0)
    def demo_radio_button():
        static = demo_radio_button
        clicked, static.value = imgui.radio_button("radio a", static.value, 0)
        imgui.same_line()
        clicked, static.value = imgui.radio_button("radio b", static.value, 1)
        imgui.same_line()
        clicked, static.value = imgui.radio_button("radio c", static.value, 2)

## Enums and TextInput

In the example below, two differences are important:

### InputText functions:

`imgui.input_text` (Python) is equivalent to `ImGui::InputText` (C++)

-   In C++, it uses two parameters for the text: the text pointer, and
    its length.

-   In Python, you can simply pass a string, and get back its modified
    value in the returned tuple.

### Enums handling:

-   `ImGuiInputTextFlags_` (C++) corresponds to `imgui.InputTextFlags_`
    (python) and it is an *enum* (note the trailing underscore).

-   `ImGuiInputTextFlags` (C++) corresponds to `imgui.InputTextFlags`
    (python) and it is an *int* (note: no trailing underscore)

You will find many similar enums.

The dichotomy between int and enums, enables you to write flags that are
a combinations of values from the enum (see example below).

### Example

C++

    void DemoInputTextUpperCase()
    {
        static char text[64] = "";
        ImGuiInputTextFlags flags = (
            ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsUppercase
            | ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsNoBlank
        );
        /*bool changed = */ ImGui::InputText("Upper case, no spaces", text, 64, flags);
    }

Python

    @immapp.static(text="")
    def demo_input_text_decimal() -> None:
        static = demo_input_text_decimal
        flags:imgui.InputTextFlags = (
                imgui.InputTextFlags_.chars_uppercase.value
              | imgui.InputTextFlags_.chars_no_blank.value
            )
        changed, static.text = imgui.input_text("Upper case, no spaces", static.text, flags)

Note: in C++, by using `imgui_stdlib.h`, it is also possible to write:

    #include "imgui/misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.h"

    void DemoInputTextUpperCase_StdString()
    {
        static std::string text;
        ImGuiInputTextFlags flags = (
            ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsUppercase
            | ImGuiInputTextFlags_CharsNoBlank
        );
        /*bool changed = */ ImGui::InputText("Upper case, no spaces", &text, flags);
    }

## Advanced glfw callbacks

When using the glfw backend, you can set advanced callbacks on all glfw
events.

Below is an example that triggers a callback whenever the window size is
changed:

    import imgui_bundle
    import glfw   # always import glfw *after* imgui_bundle!!!


    # define a callback
    def my_window_size_callback(window: glfw._GLFWwindow, w: int, h: int):
        print(f"Window size changed to {w}x{h}")


    # Get the glfw window used by hello imgui
    window = imgui_bundle.glfw_utils.glfw_window_hello_imgui()
    glfw.set_window_size_callback(window, my_window_size_callback)

It is important to import glfw *after* imgui\_bundle, since - upon
import - imgui\_bundle informs glfw that it shall use its own version of
the glfw dynamic library.

## Debug native C++ in python scripts

ImGui Bundle provides tooling to help you debug the C++ side, when you
encounter a bug that is difficult to diagnose from Python.

It can be used in two steps:

1.  Edit the file `pybind_native_debug/pybind_native_debug.py`. Change
    its content so that it runs the python code you would like to debug.
    Make sure it works when you run it as a python script.

2.  Now, debug the C++ project `pybind_native_debug_bundle` which is
    defined in the directory `pybind_native_debug/`. This will run your
    python code from C++, and you can debug the C++ side (place
    breakpoints, watch variables, etc).

Example: [this issue on
macOS](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui/issues/33) was solved thanks
to this.

# Closing words

## Who is this project for

As mentioned in the intro,

[Dear ImGui Bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) is a bundle
for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), including various
powerful libraries from its ecosystem. It enables to easily create ImGui
applications in C++ and Python, under Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is
aimed at application developers, researchers, and beginner developers
who want to quickly get started.

Dear ImGui Bundle aims to make applications prototyping fast and easy,
in a multiplatform / multi-tooling context. The intent is to reduce the
time between an idea and a first GUI prototype down to almost zero.

It is well adapted for

-   developers and researchers who want to switch easily between and
    research and development environment by facilitating the port of
    research artifacts

-   beginners and developers who want to quickly develop an application
    without learning a GUI framework

### Who is this project **not** for

You should prefer a more complete framework (such as Qt for example) if
your intent is to build a fully fledged application, with support for
internationalization, advanced styling, etc.

Also, the library makes no guarantee of ABI stability, and its API is
opened to slight adaptations and breaking changes if they are found to
make the overall usage better and/or safer.

## Acknowledgments

Dear ImGui Bundle would not be possible without the work of the authors
of "Dear ImGui", and especially [Omar
Cornut](https://www.miracleworld.net/).

It also includes a lot of other projects, and I’d like to thank their
authors for their awesome work!

## Alternatives

[pyimgui](https://pyimgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides
battle-tested comprehensive python bindings for ImGui. I worked with
this project a lot, and contributed a bit to it. In the end, I had to
develop a separate project, in order to be able to add auto-generated
and auto-documented python modules.

[Dear PyGui](https://dearpygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
([repository](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui)) provides python
bindings for ImGui with a lot of addons, and a more pythonesque API,
which makes it perhaps more suited for Python only projects.

## About the author

Dear ImGui Bundle is developed by Pascal Thomet. I am reachable on my
[Github page](https://github.com/pthom). I sometimes
[blog](http://code-ballads.net/). There is a
[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaJx_KrDECZPzttQ77Gv8DD7OAUwmtWUc)
related to ImGui Bundle on YouTube.

I have a past in computer vision, and a lot of experience in the
trenches between development and research teams; and I found ImGui to be
a nice way to reduce the delay between a research prototype and its use
in production code.

I also have an inclination for self documenting code, and the doc you
are reading was a way to explore new ways to document projects.

## How is Dear ImGui Bundle developed

The development of the initial version of Dear ImGui Bundle took about
one year at full time.

The bindings are auto-generated thanks to an advanced parser, so that
they are easy to keep up to date. I’ll give more information about the
bindings generator a bit later in 2023.

Please be tolerant if you find issues! Dear ImGui Bundle is developed
for free, under a very permissive license, by one main author (and most
of its API comes from external libraries).

If you need consulting about this library or about the bindings
generator in the context of a commercial project, please contact me by
email.

Contributions are welcome!

### History

Three of my past projects gave me the idea to develop this library.

-   [ImGui
    Manual](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html),
    an interactive manual for Dear ImGui, which I developed in June 2020

-   [implot demo](https://traineq.org/implot_demo/src/implot_demo.html)
    which I developed in 2020.

-   [imgui\_datascience](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_datascience), a
    python package I developed in 2018 for image analysis and debugging.
    Its successor is immvision.

Developments for Dear ImGui Bundle and its related automatic binding
generator began in january 2022.
