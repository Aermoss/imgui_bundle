# ImGui Bundle
[ImGui Bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) is a collection of python bindings for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git), and various libraries from its ecosystem.
The bindings were autogenerated from the original C++ code, so that they are easier to keep up to date, and the python API closely matches the C++ api.

## Batteries included
ImGui Bundle include:
* [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git) : Immediate Gui library
* [hello imgui](https://github.com/pthom/hello_imgui.git): multiplatform backend provider for imgui
* [implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot): plotting library based on ImGui
* [ImGuiColorTextEdit](external/ImGuiColorTextEdit): Colorizing text editor
* [imgui-node-editor](https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor): Node editor
* [imgui-knobs](https://github.com/altschuler/imgui-knobs): Knobs for ImGui
* [ImFileDialog](https://github.com/pthom/ImFileDialog.git): File dialogs 
* [imgui_md (markdown)](https://github.com/mekhontsev/imgui_md.git): Markdown for ImGui
* [imspinner](https://github.com/dalerank/imspinner): Spinners 

## Philosophy
* Closely mirrors the original API of ImGui and other libraries
* Original code documentation is consciously kept inside the python stubs. See for example the documentation for:
    * [imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui.pyi)
    * [implot](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/implot.pyi)
    * [hello imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi)
* Fully typed bindings, so that code completion works like a charm
